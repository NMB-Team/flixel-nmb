## About

HaxeFlixel has its roots in the original [ActionScript 3 version of Flixel](https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel), created by [Adam “Atomic” Saltsman](https://www.adamatomic.com/). It was started by [Alexander Hohlov](https://github.com/beeblerox) in 2011, initially as a straightforward Haxe port of the AS3 codebase and Richard Davey's [Flixel Power Tools](https://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools).

Thanks to the efforts of the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/HaxeFlixel/people) as well as [over 100 contributors](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel/graphs/contributors), today's version of HaxeFlixel far surpasses the capabilities of the original. Not only has the core engine seen many substantial improvements and new features, there is also a far richer ecosystem with additional libraries and [over 80 demo projects](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-demos) to learn from.
